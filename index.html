<a id="compilation-and-installation" class="anchor" href="#compilation-and-installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Compilation and installation</h1>

<p>In order to compile Bluetooth utilities you need following software packages:
    - GCC compiler
    - GLib library
    - D-Bus library
    - udev library (optional)
    - readline (command line clients)</p>

<p>To configure run:
    ./configure --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man \
                --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var</p>

<p>Configure automatically searches for all required components and packages.</p>

<p>To compile and install run:
    make &amp;&amp; make install</p>

<a id="configuration-and-options" class="anchor" href="#configuration-and-options" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configuration and options</h1>

<p>For a working system, certain configuration options need to be enabled:</p>

<pre><code>--enable-library

    Enable installation of Bluetooth library

    By default the Bluetooth library is no longer installed.

    The user interfaces or command line utilities do not
    require an installed Bluetooth library anymore. This
    option is provided for legacy third party applications
    that still depend on the library.

    When the library installation is enabled, it is a good
    idea to use a separate bluez-library or libbluetooth
    package for it.

--disable-tools

    Disable support for Bluetooth utilities

    By default the Bluetooth utilities are built and also
    installed. For production systems the tools are not
    needed and this option allows to disable them to save
    build time and disk space.

    When the tools are selected, it is a good idea to
    use a separate bluez-tools package for them.

--disable-cups

    Disable support for CUPS printer backend

    By default the printer backend for CUPS is build and
    also installed. For systems that do not require printing
    over Bluetooth, this options allows to disable it.

    When the CUPS backend is selected, it is a good idea to
    use a separate bluez-cups package for it.

--disable-monitor

    Disable support for the Bluetooth monitor utility

    By default the monitor utility is enabled. It provides
    support for HCI level tracing and debugging. For systems
    that don't require any kind of tracing or debugging
    capabilities, this options allows to disable it.

    The monitor utility should be placed in the main package
    along with the daemons. It is universally useful.

--disable-client

    Disable support for the command line client

    By default the command line client is enabled and uses the
    readline library. For specific systems where BlueZ is
    configured by other means, the command line client can be
    disabled and the dependency on readline is removed.

    The client should be placed in the main package along
    with the daemons. It is universally useful.

--disable-systemd

    Disable integration with systemd

    By default the integration with systemd is enabled and
    installed. This gives the best integration into all
    distributions based on systemd.

    This option is provided for distributions that do not
    support systemd. In that case all integration with the
    init system is up to the package.

--enable-experimental

    Enable experimental plugins

    By default all plugins that are still in development
    are disabled. This option can be used to enable them.

    It is not recommended to enable this option for production
    systems. The APIs or behavior of the experimental plugins
    is unstable and might still change.
