This\r\n\t\toption is provided for legacy third party applications\r\n\t\tthat still depend on the library.\r\n\r\n\t\tWhen the library installation is enabled, it is a good\r\n\t\tidea to use a separate bluez-library or libbluetooth\r\n\t\tpackage for it.\r\n\r\n\t--disable-tools\r\n\r\n\t\tDisable support for Bluetooth utilities\r\n\r\n\t\tBy default the Bluetooth utilities are built and also\r\n\t\tinstalled. For production systems the tools are not\r\n\t\tneeded and this option allows to disable them to save\r\n\t\tbuild time and disk space.\r\n\r\n\t\tWhen the tools are selected, it is a good idea to\r\n\t\tuse a separate bluez-tools package for them.\r\n\r\n\t--disable-cups\r\n\r\n\t\tDisable support for CUPS printer backend\r\n\r\n\t\tBy default the printer backend for CUPS is build and\r\n\t\talso installed. For systems that do not require printing\r\n\t\tover Bluetooth, this options allows to disable it.\r\n\r\n\t\tWhen the CUPS backend is selected, it is a good idea to\r\n\t\tuse a separate bluez-cups package for it.\r\n\r\n\t--disable-monitor\r\n\r\n\t\tDisable support for the Bluetooth monitor utility\r\n\r\n\t\tBy default the monitor utility is enabled. It provides\r\n\t\tsupport for HCI level tracing and debugging. For systems\r\n\t\tthat don't require any kind of tracing or debugging\r\n\t\tcapabilities, this options allows to disable it.\r\n\r\n\t\tThe monitor utility should be placed in the main package\r\n\t\talong with the daemons. It is universally useful.\r\n\r\n\t--disable-client\r\n\r\n\t\tDisable support for the command line client\r\n\r\n\t\tBy default the command line client is enabled and uses the\r\n\t\treadline library. For specific systems where BlueZ is\r\n\t\tconfigured by other means, the command line client can be\r\n\t\tdisabled and the dependency on readline is removed.\r\n\r\n\t\tThe client should be placed in the main package along\r\n\t\twith the daemons. It is universally useful.\r\n\r\n\t--disable-systemd\r\n\r\n\t\tDisable integration with systemd\r\n\r\n\t\tBy default the integration with systemd is enabled and\r\n\t\tinstalled. This gives the best integration into all\r\n\t\tdistributions based on systemd.\r\n\r\n\t\tThis option is provided for distributions that do not\r\n\t\tsupport systemd. In that case all integration with the\r\n\t\tinit system is up to the package.\r\n\r\n\t--enable-experimental\r\n\r\n\t\tEnable experimental plugins\r\n\r\n\t\tBy default all plugins that are still in development\r\n\t\tare disabled. This option can be used to enable them.\r\n\r\n\t\tIt is not recommended to enable this option for production\r\n\t\tsystems. The APIs or behavior of the experimental plugins\r\n\t\tis unstable and might still change.\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation\r\n===========\r\n\r\nMailing lists:\r\n\tlinux-bluetooth@vger.kernel.org\r\n\r\nFor additional information about the project visit BlueZ web site:\r\n\thttp://www.bluez.org","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
